# Photon_Trajectory_Simulations by Vivaan Chaturvedi (Loomis Chaffee)
The Python code NOTEBOOK provides simulated photon trajectories in the vicinity of black holes from different initial conditions.
It uses NUMPY for efficient Vectorized numberical operations 
MATPLOT is used to plot the photon trajectory and the blackhole
